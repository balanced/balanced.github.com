#### Art.sy + Balanced
Balanced works with many existing online marketplaces, helping them move money between buyers and sellers. But over the past few months Balanced has helped several large online communities actually *become* marketplaces. 

Continuing that trend, Balanced is very happy to announce that it has been selected by [Art.sy](http://artsy.net) to power the New York-based art platform's eCommerce transactions.

Art.sy's mission is to make all the world's art accessible to anyone with an Internet connection, and it's off to a great start with over 21,000 pieces of art available for viewing on its platform. Now, users can purchase select pieces directly from the Art.sy site using Balanced's marketplace payments system. Check out their holiday collection as an example: [Art.sy Collecting](http://artsy.net/collecting).

We're very excited to be working with the great team at Art.sy!

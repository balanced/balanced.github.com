#### Visual.ly + Balanced
A few months ago, [Visual.ly](http://visual.ly), the online platform for infographics, quietly rolled out an [online marketplace](http://visual.ly/marketplace) that allowed users to select and pay designers for custom infographic projects. Today, we're happy to announce that Balanced is the payments company powering Visual.ly's marketplace. 

You might not see it on Visual.ly's site, but Balanced's white-label API is being used to:

1. [process credit cards](https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/api?language=bash#create-a-new-debit),
2. hold the funds in an [escrow-like](https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/overview?language=bash#escrow) account, and 
3. [payout](https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/api?language=bash#credit-a-new-bank-account) those funds directly to designers' bank accounts via next-day ACH

For Visual.ly, adding the marketplace functionality was a clear next step, since users of their platform were already contacting each other to complete design work -- why not make the user experience better for both parties while collecting a bit of money themselves. We're thrilled to be working with Visual.ly on this critical piece of their vision.

Adam Breckler, co-founder and head of product shares [why Visual.ly is using Balanced for their marketplace payments](http://www.quora.com/Balanced/Why-do-you-use-Balanced-for-payments/answer/Adam-Breckler) on Quora. 

#### This is becoming a trend
Balanced has helped several other online communities - including [reddit](redditgifts.com/marketplace) and [Fancy](thefancy.com) -  add a marketplace-style  ecommerce experiences to their sites. Last week, it was announced that [Balanced is behind Art.sy's ecommerce transactions](blog.balancedpayments.com/artsy-balanced) as well.

### Pay your merchants (even) faster!

"Get money to a recipient, in a usable form, as quickly as possible." This is a maxim of Balanced's product philosophy, and we're obsessed with increasing the speed of our ACH payouts. We're happy to announce we now support __same-day__ payouts to all Wells Fargo customers -- about 15% of bank account holders in the US!

#### Better than industry standard:
Balanced already provides next business day payouts, much faster than the industry standard 3-5 days. Thanks to a new banking partnership, we now offer same-day payouts to all Wells Fargo customers. Dwolla, by comparison, takes 2-3 days to pay out to their merchants' bank accounts, PayPal: 3-5 days, and Stripe takes 7 days. Look for more banks to be added to our same-day payout program in the future. 

#### What customers are saying:
Balanced customers have already praised the speed of our ACH payouts:

James Beshara, CEO [Crowdtilt](https://www.crowdtilt.com/):
>Another reason we chose Balanced was 24 hr next day direct deposit. This was a feature for our use case that became a must-have as soon as we told users that it was possible. For our users, if you're collecting money for a party bus on Friday night or the tailgate on Saturday, you're likely going to begin collecting that money the week of the event.

[GroupTalent](https://grouptalent.com/main/employers/):
>Our developers LOVE how fast and easily they get paid. It's really amazing. [[source](https://twitter.com/grouptalent/status/301763495106596865)]

Now 15% of our payouts are even faster!

#### What this means for Balanced customers:
Same-day payouts to Wells Fargo customers will be made immediately available to all Balanced developers, whether you're using just [Balanced Payouts](http://blog.balancedpayments.com/announcing-balanced-payouts/) or Processing and Payouts together. No action is required to begin using same-day payouts. Balanced will simply begin speeding up payouts for eligible merchants.

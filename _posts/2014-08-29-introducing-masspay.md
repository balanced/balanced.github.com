Paying out to thousands of customers can be a tedius task. With MassPay, you’re now able to import payouts to the dashboard directly from a CSV in order to send out large numbers of credits to your customers and sellers.

We've gone through multiple iterations based on the feedback from our customers to make the MassPay experience as seamless as possible. Based on the feedback, we have improved the way you handle errors, as well as illustrating how to format a CSV file. One of our beta testers, <a href="http://www.shyp.com/">Shyp</a>, mentioned that it was easy to use and worked well for them.

MassPay can be used in many different ways. <a href="http://www.shyp.com/">Shyp</a> heavily uses MassPay to pay out to all of their Heros. <a href="https://coursehorse.com/">CourseHorse</a> uses it to pay out to their partner schools. At <a href="http://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced</a>, we use it to make reimbursements to our employees.

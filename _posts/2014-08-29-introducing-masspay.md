Paying out to thousands of customers can be a tedius task. With MassPay, you’re now able to import payouts to the dashboard directly from a CSV in order to send out large numbers of credits to your customers and sellers.

We've gone through multiple iterations based on the feedback from our customers to make the MassPay experience as seamless as possible. We've added step-by-step instructions to illustrate how to format a CSV file, as well as improving the way you handle errors in the preview step.

In another effort to streamline things on the Balanced dashboard, we’d also like to announce the introduction of a new MassPay feature! You’re now able to import payouts to the dashboard directly from a CSV in order to send out large numbers of credits to your customers and sellers. We’ve included step-by-step instructions of how to do this directly in your dashboard, so please review this by clicking on the “Import payouts” link on your dashboard directly next to the transaction export link.
